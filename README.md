# Install Ubuntu20 on Termux Android

This installs Ubuntu 20 with xfce4 desktop on Termux. All scripts are from Andronix, I just compose and edit them to make the installer easier and smoother. It includes:

- [x] Ubuntu 20
- [x] XFCE4 Desktop
- [x] TigerVNC Server
- [x] Non-root Account Creation
- [x] Audio Support
- [x] Chromium Browser

## Installation

Copy and paste this command to Termux:

```bash
pkg update -y && pkg install wget curl proot tar -y && wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/tuanpham-dev/termux-ubuntu/master/ubuntu.sh && chmod +x ubuntu.sh && bash ubuntu.sh
```

Then start Ubuntu:
```bash
./start-ubuntu.sh
```

Clone and run the setup to initialise Ubuntu and install sudo, XFCE Desktop, VNC server, etc.
```bash
apt update
apt install git -y

# clone the scripts in from this repo
git clone https://github.com/tuanpham-dev/termux-ubuntu.git
cd termux-ubuntu
# make them executable
chmod +x -R .

# start and follow the instructions of the first run wizard
./firstrun
```

## Run

### Start Ubuntu

After installation, on Termux, you can execute this command to run ubuntu:

```bash
./start-ubuntu.sh
```

### Exit Ubuntu

To exit ubuntu you can simply run `exit` command. This will stop vncserver and some services.

```
exit
```

### Start VNC Server

On Ubuntu, run this command to start VNC Server:

```bash
vncserver-start
```

Then you can use VNC Client to connect to `127.0.0.1:1` or `127.0.0.1:5901`

### Stop VNC Server

On Ubuntu, run this command to stop VNC Server:

```bash
vncserver-stop
```

## Issues

### Group Issue

If you get an issue message like this:

```
groups: cannot find name for group ID 20305

```

You can simply add group with this command:

```
sudo groupadd --gid 20305 permagrp5
sudo groupadd --gid 50305 permagrp6
```
